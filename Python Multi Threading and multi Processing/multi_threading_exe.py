# Real-World Example: Multithreading for I/0-bound Tasks
# Scenario: Web Scraping
# Web scraping often involves making numerous network requests to fetch web pages.
#These tasks are I/0-boundâ€¢ because they spend a lot of time waiting for responses from servers.
# Multithreading can significantly improve the performance by allowing multiple web pages to be fetched concurrently.
